# Git Commands 

I learned some important commands in this repository.
first one is 
```git
$ git init
```
With this feature I initialized  the working directory...

## Here are some of the tools I used and learned.

```git
$ git log
$ git add .
$ git commit
$ git status
$ git branch
$ git merge
$ git remote add
$ git pull
$ git push 
```
Each command is divided into several commands as there is in $ git commit
```git
$ git commit -a
$ git commit -m
...
